# Price Surge Detection using Simulated Data (Mini ML Project)

This project is a machine learning pipeline designed to detect and analyze **price surge patterns** using simulated data. It was created as part of a mini project to demonstrate proficiency in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.


## Project Objective

To build an end-to-end pipeline that predicts whether a **price surge** will occur based on various transactional and demand-related features.


## Skills Demonstrated

- **Feature Engineering**: Created new variables that capture demand intensity, day-of-week trends, and location-based insights.
- **Modeling**: Trained multiple ML models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree to classify surge vs. no-surge events.
- **Evaluation**: Compared model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Tuned hyperparameters for improved generalization.
- **Interpretability**: Analyzed feature importances to explain model behavior and business relevance.


## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Approach**: Supervised binary classification


## Key Learnings

- Gained hands-on experience simulating and modeling real-world-like business problems.
- Understood the impact of class imbalance and how to mitigate it through modeling strategy.
- Improved ability to explain model results to both technical and non-technical audiences.


## Notebook

The full implementation, from data generation to final model evaluation, can be found in the [`mpp2.ipynb`](./mpp2.ipynb) notebook.
